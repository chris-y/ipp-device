Build and Installation instructions for ipr.

Building ipr
-------------

There are two ways to build this: 1) standalone 2) with CUPS

1) In standalone mode, use pre-packaged cups library files directly in the build:
a) on windows, load ipr.dsw into Visual Studio and build, or:
cd ipr-cups/ipr & build.bat
b) on linux:
cd ipr-cups; make
note: in this release, you may need to tweek ipr-cups/Makefile and ipr-cups/Madedefs to
get it work on your system.


2) With Cups:
a) Download CUPS sources
b) copy ipr-cups/ipr into cups-1.1.21rc1 or appropriate install directory for CUPS, e.g.:
cp -a ipr-cups/ipr cups-1.1.21rc1 
c) Follow usual CUPS instructions: ./configure, make
d) cd ipr; make; ./install.sh


Packaging binary distribution:
------------------------------

On windows, run:
cd ipr-cups & dist.bat


On linux, run:
cd ipr-cups/ipr; dist.sh


dist files will be located in:
../dist/win32 and ../dist/linux respectively
