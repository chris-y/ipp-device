Type:         driver/print
Version:      1.1
Architecture: ppc-amigaos >= 4.0.0

Basic device driver implementing the Internet Printing Protocol.

To use:
Copy ipp.device to Devs:
Copy IPP0 to Devs:DOSDrivers
SetEnv SAVE ipp.device/0 ipp://printserver:631/printers/Printer-Name
If you are using a CUPS server, you must use the PostScript driver.
Set the port device to ipp.device.

AmigaOS printing should now go to the network printer.  Some programs
have internal PostScript printer support or PostScript save abillity.
It is advised to point these at IPP0: rather than going through the
AmigaOS standard print options.

You can print PostScript documents by copying them to IPP0:
If you have mode than one network printer create a copy of IPP0,
and call it IPP1, editing the Unit line in the file.
